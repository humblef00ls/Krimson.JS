                    <p> 
                        Krimson is really just a pre-written CSS and JQuery file that helps you set up cool looking components and UI with little to no effort.
                    </p>
                    General design philosophy
                    <p> 
                        I definetly consider my designs extra, but even so I don't agree with 'function over form', because in 2019 (Year I've made this), we 
                        can have both. And so for this reason I've made sure that each component is not only highly customisable with a lot of options to match
                        your specific need, but also generally dynamic and UI friendly. An example of this would be something as simple yet important as the use
                        of the most effecient transform property for animations whereever possible.
                        </p>
                    So why does this exist?
                    <p>
                        Well, I was tired of using front-end frameworks and libaries only to spend a lot of time customising everything anyway, 
                         and my superior at my internship said maybe you should just save all the components you make from each project and use 
                         them if you hate common material design or 2008 aesthetics, so I did. But instead of just making a master CSS file for personal use 
                         I decided that I could do this whole front-end framework thing different and maybe better.
                         <br><br>
                         Now, It's not that I think other libraries/frame-works like vuetify or other frameworks which use material design are bad, in fact before 
                         this I would sometimes use Materialize when I felt too lazy to hard custom code certain components. I just feel like not everything has to 
                         look like it's made by Google's B team. The goal behind Krimson is to not only be visually apealing and super easy to use, but also to be fully customisable.
                         <br><br>
                         The whole reason I made this was because I wanted to do everything my own way and according to the style of the product, and so I've tried my
                         best to make every class very easily customisable and work well with your own coding style. This might not seem like too big a deal to most people
                         as customising framework components is as simple as inline CSS, but after spending a month with vue and vuetify turns out this isnt always true 
                         and for people not super familiar with a framework this can end up taking much more time, making the whole point of a pre-made library of components   
                         redundant. In fact to this point I've even added tips to components I feel like would need to be customised more than others, like the text-gradient.
